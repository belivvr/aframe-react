 * The pool component allows for [object pooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern).

 * destroying the same kind of entities in dynamic scenes.
 * Object pooling helps reduce garbage collection pauses.
 *
 * Note that entities requested from the pool are paused by default and you need to call `.play()`
 * in order to activate their componentsâ€™ tick functions.
