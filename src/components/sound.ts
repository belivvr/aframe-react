/**
 * The sound component defines the entity as a source of sound or audio.
 * The sound component is positional and is thus affected by the [components-position](https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/components/position.html).
 *
 * > NOTE: Playing sound on iOS — in any browser — requires a physical user interaction.
 * > This is a browser limitation, and internal A-Frame events (like fusing cursors)
 * > do not count as interaction.
 * > Ways to deal with this include using a Begin Experience button to start ambient music,
 * > or creating audio sprites with libraries like [Howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js).
